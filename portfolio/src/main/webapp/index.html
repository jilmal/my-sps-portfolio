                            Currently for my Junior Design Project, my team and I have been working alongside a client to create an application 
                            for housing experts to more effectively counsel African American communities suffering from a lack of housing justice. 
                            These communties are suffering from a vast number of issues including gentrification, home abandonment, mortgage crisis, etc.
                            The platform allows counselors to quickly assess homeowner concerns and turn over solutions immediatly on a case by case basis.

                            My team and I researched and developed the UI for a Fortnite Esports platform targeted to help 
                            streamline the process for novice players to become pro players. The main feature of the application
                            highlights users' "problem areas" (i.e. poor aim performance) and provides training videos and guides
                            to improve the player's skill.

                            During my internship at IBM, my team and I created a web application for physicians 
                            and transplant centers to mitigate organ waste currently happening in hospital systems.
                            I worked alongside 2 other peers to implement the frontend of the platform utilizing HTML,
                            CSS, and Materialze.

                            During my Programming for Hardware/Software Systems course, I created a cowboy adventure video game
                            utilizing a Hash Table implementation in C to render the game objects, maps, and sprites. The game 
                            was ran on an Mbed microcontroller which allowed the users to navigate the game through motion detection
                            and interact with objects through external buttons.

                            Although I just started taking the hobby more serious, I've really enjoyed the challenge 
                            of learning how to skateboard. It's a very grueling sport that teaches you the value of 
                            getting up and trying again and again after each fall. I really value skateboarding because
                            it constantly pushes me outside my comfort zone and forces me to take risks all while reminding
                            me that persistance is necessary to meet my goals when trying to land a new trick.

                        <p>
                            It wasn't until my junior year of college that I became very invested in the fashion world 
                            and grew an obsession for thrifting and discovering my own style. Thrifting not only helps
                            the environment, but it also presents creative challenges when browsing different materials,
                            patterns, and pieces to create new looks.

                        <p>
                            Growing up video games played an integral part of my life and not only provided
                            an outlet for relieving stress, but also sparked my interest in learning more 
                            about computer science. Nowadays, given a busy college schedule, having the freetime
                            to play games is a bit more rare, but when I am I usually stick to competitive 
                            shooters like CSGO (although I'm not very good anymore).
